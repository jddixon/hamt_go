    * clean up, save, step version number
    * to make this thing useful:
        - add buckets at the bottom level (in a 32K run, with random
            keys, there were 6 entries at level 6, 150 at level5)
        - where Table32.Delete() leaves empty table, need to remove 
            the table from the data structure - recursively
    * documentation needs to mention POPCNT/SWAR

2014-04-05
    * implement HAMT32 and tests first, then HAMT64 and tests           * DONE

2014-04-04
    * need perf tests, all 6 variants (32,64 * 3)
        * must clearly identify OS, hardware, Go version
    * eventually need option to use hardware POPCNT if available
    * need docs
        - and figures
        - docs, figures get imported into gh-pages
    * project README should refer to github.io (ie, gh-pages)
